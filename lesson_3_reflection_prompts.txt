When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want working the files on different computers or have others work on the project as well.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is similar to a clone but can only be done on github. Branches are different direction of your repository that do not effect the master branch.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Help tell the difference of the local state and remote.
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Google docs would be easier to save changes but harder undo changed that I do not want.
