How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Having the entire history you can see when you made what changes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Choosing when to commit on your own gives the commits more meaning. Saving automatically has the advantage of you not having to remeber to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is greed toward program where files are realted to each other. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   git log will show the entire history where git diff will show the diffrance btween commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
